# HanyangLabs
After my first year at University, I was awarded an academic scholarship to study at the prestigious Hanyang University in South Korea during my summer. You can read more about my experience here: www.liamsorta.co.uk/a-summer-in-seoul/  Here are some of my lab sheets from my time there - most of these are uncommented. If I get chance, I will revisit this and upload my lecture notes / include some form of documentation.
